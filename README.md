# Bing

A restful bing api, but this api **IS NOT AVAILABLE CURRENTLY** because of there is no image host :disappointed_relieved: (will be fixed as soon as possible)  
**Only Chinese is supported currently**. I will be very glad for if you can provide data in other languages.

1. Get a random image:
```url
GET https://api.339.im:1015/bing/v1/random
```

2. Get an image by date
```url
GET https://api.339.im:1015/bing/v1/getByDate?date={yyyyMMdd}
```
